## ü§ñüìà Strategy
- The bot take a series of recomendations given by Trading View and proccess them together with the tendency of the rest of people betting. After the algorithm have complete, it choose to bet **üü¢UP** or **üî¥DOWN**.
- After all my testings in aprox 300 rounds I was able to achieve a **~70% Win rate**. Of course it depends of a lot of variables, so I can't ensure that you will reproduce the same behavior. But I can tell that I make $20 - $70 daily with $3 Bets.
- Before every round the bot will check if you have enough balance in your wallet and if you have reached the daily goal.
- Also it will save the daily history in the **/history** directory.
- Be aware that after consecutive losses, statistically you have more chances to win in the next one.
- Inside **bot.js** in the ``THRESHOLD`` property of ``GLOBAL_CONFIG`` variable, you can configure the minimum certainty with which the bot will bet. For default it's set to 50, which means that from 50% certainty the bot will bet. You can raise it (50-100) to bet only when the bot is more sure about its prediction.
- Its recomendable to have x10 - x50 the amount of bet to have an average of rounds.
- There is also a possibility to copy trades in the new Version. Just change the method to "copy" or Both.
